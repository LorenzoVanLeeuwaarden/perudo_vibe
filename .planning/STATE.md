## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: PartyKit selected for real-time infrastructure (edge-deployed, free tier, room abstractions)
- [Roadmap]: Server-authoritative architecture required (not layering networking on client state)
- [01-01]: party/ at project root, not inside src/ (PartyKit convention)
- [01-01]: src/shared/ for types importable by both client and server
- [01-01]: src/stores/ for Zustand stores separate from other client code
