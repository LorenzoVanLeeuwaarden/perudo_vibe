## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Text chat | Moderation concerns, complexity; emotes sufficient for casual game |
| Spectator mode | Low value for small friend groups; watch via Discord screenshare |
| Matchmaking / public lobbies | Requires player base, moderation, anti-cheat; private rooms via link only |
| Global leaderboards | Requires accounts, anti-cheat; per-game stats sufficient |
| Custom avatars / profiles | Scope creep, asset management; player colors sufficient |
| In-game voice chat | WebRTC complexity, moderation; use Discord externally |
| Tournament mode | Complex bracket management; single-game focus for v1 |
| Game variants | Each variant needs balancing, testing; wild ones toggle sufficient |
| Mobile app | Platform-specific development; responsive web covers mobile browsers |
