# Roadmap Archive: v3.1 Tutorial

**Shipped:** 2026-01-23

## Phases

### Phase 23: Tutorial Foundation
**Goal**: Tutorial infrastructure exists with scripted gameplay that reuses existing components

**Dependencies**: None (builds on existing single-player infrastructure)

**Requirements**: FLOW-01, GAME-01, GAME-02, GAME-05, VIS-04

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can click "How to Play" button on main menu and enter tutorial mode
2. Tutorial presents a 3-player game with user and 2 AI opponents
3. Dice rolls produce predetermined values that create specific teaching scenarios
4. Tutorial uses actual game components (BidUI, Dice, SortedDiceDisplay) for authentic feel
5. No real game penalties apply — tutorial is explicitly a safe learning environment

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 23-01-PLAN.md — Tutorial store and main menu entry point
- [x] 23-02-PLAN.md — Tutorial script and gameplay component
- [x] 23-03-PLAN.md — Tutorial screen integration and first-time prompt

### Phase 24: Tutorial Guidance
**Goal**: Interactive guidance system teaches through constrained choices with inline explanations

**Dependencies**: Phase 23 (requires tutorial gameplay skeleton)

**Requirements**: GAME-03, GAME-04, VIS-01, VIS-02, VIS-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. User's move choices are constrained to the intended tutorial action at each step
2. Disabled options show tooltip explaining why they are unavailable ("First, let's learn basic bidding")
3. Inline tooltips appear with 1-2 sentence explanations at each teaching moment
4. Visual cues (highlights, subtle arrows) draw attention to interactive elements
5. Dice relevant to the current explanation pulse or glow to focus attention

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 24-01-PLAN.md — Tooltip components (TutorialTooltip, TutorialOverlay, DisabledButtonWrapper)
- [x] 24-02-PLAN.md — Script enhancement with tooltip and highlighting data
- [x] 24-03-PLAN.md — TutorialGameplay integration with constrained actions

### Phase 25: Tutorial Content & Polish
**Goal**: Complete tutorial teaches all core rules with completion celebration

**Dependencies**: Phase 24 (requires guidance system infrastructure)

**Requirements**: FLOW-04, FLOW-05, FLOW-06, CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, CONT-04

**Note:** FLOW-02 (skip button) and FLOW-03 (progress indicator) descoped per CONTEXT.md decisions - tutorial is short enough to complete in one sitting.

**Success Criteria:**
1. User learns basic bidding (what a bid is, how to make one) - covered by Phase 23-24
2. User learns calling Dudo (when to challenge, what happens when you call) - covered by Phase 23-24
3. User learns wild ones rule (ones count as any face value)
4. User learns Calza (exact match challenge)
5. User can exit mid-tutorial and return to main menu (exit button visible throughout)
6. Celebration (confetti) plays on tutorial completion
7. Tutorial auto-returns to main menu after celebration
8. Tutorial completion persists (app does not auto-prompt returning players) - covered by Phase 23

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 25-01-PLAN.md — Tutorial content expansion (wild ones, Calza teaching steps)
- [x] 25-02-PLAN.md — Calza button and completion celebration (confetti, auto-return)
