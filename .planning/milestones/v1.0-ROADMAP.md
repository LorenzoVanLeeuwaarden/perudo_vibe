# Milestone v1.0: Perudo Vibe Multiplayer

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-9
**Total Plans:** 22

## Overview

This milestone transformed Perudo Vibe from a single-player browser game into a real-time multiplayer experience where friends can play together via shareable links. The journey started with architecture foundation (server-authoritative state, shared types) then built progressively: room infrastructure, lobby experience, game synchronization, turn management, disconnect handling, and finally social polish.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Foundation

**Goal:** Establish the server-authoritative architecture with shared types and message protocol that enables all multiplayer features
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements:** None directly (prerequisite infrastructure)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Install dependencies and create project structure
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Define shared types and message protocol with Zod
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Create Zustand stores and PartyKit server skeleton

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ Shared TypeScript types exist for game state, player state, and room state
2. ✓ Message protocol defined with Zod schemas for all client-server messages
3. ✓ Game state types separate server-authoritative state from client UI state
4. ✓ Project structure supports both PartyKit server and Next.js client

### Phase 2: Mode Selection

**Goal:** Users can choose between single-player (vs AI) and multiplayer modes from the landing page
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Requirements:** MODE-01
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Add ModeSelection screen with AI/multiplayer choice and preference persistence

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ User sees clear choice between "Play vs AI" and "Play with Friends" on landing page
2. ✓ Selecting "Play vs AI" starts single-player game with existing flow
3. ✓ Selecting "Play with Friends" initiates multiplayer room creation flow

### Phase 3: Room Creation

**Goal:** Users can create multiplayer rooms and receive shareable links to invite friends
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Requirements:** ROOM-01
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Room code utilities and PartySocket connection infrastructure
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — RoomShare UI, RoomLobby, room page route, and ModeSelection integration

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ User clicking "Play with Friends" creates a new room
2. ✓ Room has a short, memorable code (e.g., X7KM3P) in the URL
3. ✓ User can copy the shareable link to clipboard
4. ✓ Room persists and is joinable by others via the link

### Phase 4: Join Flow

**Goal:** Users can join rooms via link with a guest nickname
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Requirements:** ROOM-02
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Server-side join flow infrastructure with client identity persistence
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Client-side join flow UI with JoinForm and state machine

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ User opening a room link sees a nickname entry prompt
2. ✓ User can enter nickname (2-12 characters) and join the room
3. ✓ User is placed in the room lobby after joining
4. ✓ Multiple users can join the same room via the same link

### Phase 5: Lobby Experience

**Goal:** Players in lobby can see each other, host can manage the room and start the game
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Requirements:** ROOM-03, ROOM-04, ROOM-05, HOST-01
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Server-side lobby handlers (UPDATE_SETTINGS, KICK_PLAYER, START_GAME) and host transfer
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Lobby UI components (PlayerList, KickConfirmDialog, GameSettingsModal) and integration

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ All players in lobby see the player list with names in real-time
2. ✓ Host is clearly indicated (crown icon or similar) to all players
3. ✓ Host can kick players from the lobby before game starts
4. ✓ Host can configure game settings (starting dice count, wild ones toggle)
5. ✓ Host can start the game when 2-6 players are present

### Phase 6: Game State Sync

**Goal:** All players see the same public game state in real-time, with hidden information (dice) properly filtered per player
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Requirements:** SYNC-01, SYNC-02, SYNC-03, TURN-03
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Server-side game handlers (ROLL_DICE, PLACE_BID, CALL_DUDO, CALL_CALZA, CONTINUE_ROUND)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Client message handling and GameBoard component
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Reveal animation sequence and full game loop verification

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ Each player only sees their own dice — server never sends other players' dice values to clients
2. ✓ All players see identical public state (bids, dice counts, eliminations) in real-time
3. ✓ State updates arrive within 200ms for all connected players
4. ✓ Current player's turn is highlighted for all players
5. ✓ Turn order is visible showing who plays next
6. ✓ Players see visual confirmation when their action (bid, dudo, calza) is received
7. ✓ On reveal (Dudo/Calza), all dice are shown to all players simultaneously

### Phase 7: Turn Timers

**Goal:** Each turn has a visible timer and AI takes over if player times out
**Depends on:** Phase 6
**Requirements:** TURN-01, TURN-02
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Server timer infrastructure with PartyKit alarms and conservative timeout AI
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — TurnTimer UI component with progress bar, color transitions, and AI badge
- [x] 07-03-PLAN.md — Settings modal update (remove Unlimited) and full integration verification

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ All players see a countdown timer during active player's turn
2. ✓ Timer is synchronized across all clients (same time shown)
3. ✓ If timer expires, AI automatically takes the turn for the player
4. ✓ Other players see indication that AI made a move due to timeout

### Phase 8: Disconnect and Reconnection

**Goal:** Players can reconnect after disconnection, with AI maintaining their position until they return
**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Requirements:** SYNC-04, DISC-01, DISC-02, DISC-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ Player refreshing the page can rejoin the game with their state intact
2. ✓ Disconnected player has a grace period (60 seconds) to reconnect
3. ✓ AI plays on behalf of disconnected player until they reconnect
4. ✓ Other players see a visual indicator showing which player is disconnected
5. ✓ Reconnecting player resumes control from AI seamlessly

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✓ Players can send quick reactions/emotes visible to all players during the game
2. ✓ After game ends, all players return to the lobby for potential rematch

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- PartyKit selected for real-time infrastructure (edge-deployed, free tier, room abstractions)
- Server-authoritative architecture required (not layering networking on client state)
- Zustand store separation (gameStore for network, uiStore for local)
- 60-second grace period for reconnection
- Turn-based Calza (not interrupt) per standard Perudo rules
- 8-second celebration duration before results screen

**Issues Resolved:**
- Game state synchronization bugs (13 fixes during Phase 6 verification)
- WebSocket connection timing for reconnection (Phase 8)
- React state update timing issues (deferred with setTimeout)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Sound files are placeholders (need download from royalty-free sources)
- ESLint configuration issue (using tsc --noEmit for type checking instead)
